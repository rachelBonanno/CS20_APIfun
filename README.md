# Questions
What were the most challenging and most satisfying things about doing this assignment?
- The most challenging part of this assignment was getting the fetch to work like the get function. I wasn't able to call it through a function in the same script as the GET request. So I had to make a new script which wasn't to hard. The most satisfying past of the assignment was making the boxes change color on hover and the wait for the punchline of the joke appearing.
